				Originally from Tahiti (French Polynesia)🌴, I traveled across many countries and I have always enjoyed my cultural journeys and learnt a lot from them 🔥. Currently studying at ESSEC business school on the Asia-Pacific campus, I am really interested in matters such as economics, finance and even politics.

				<h2>Economics 📈</h2>
				<p>
				<em>Economics</em> is a very interesting social science to study; it can be defined as how people satisfy needs while our ressources are limited and therefore how we allocate these ressources. <em>It's a matter of cost</em>!

				<h2>Finance 🏦</h2>
				<p>
				<em>Finance</em> is the core of our modern world. Understanding it is essential, using it is crucial ! Liking it as a subject could be strange, isn't it ?  
				</p>

				<h2>Politics 🏛</h2>
				<p>
				<em>Political sciences</em> are my favorite ! Although the general public does not see them positively, they remain vital to our societies. <em>Politics is the art of deciding and managing our communities...</em> Let's try to do so together !
